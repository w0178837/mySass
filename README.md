# My Initial Attempt at Sass


This repo is the result of taking Ray Villalobos' course [Sass Essential Training](https://www.lynda.com/Sass-tutorials/Sass-Essential-Training/375925-2.html).

I have taken his code, and modified it as I played with and learned the basics of Sass.

His code is available on GitHub at [planetoftheweb](https://github.com/planetoftheweb/sassEssentials) on GitHub
